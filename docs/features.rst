Formulas
========

Formulas are Python scripts. Example::

    return plominoDocument.getItem('price') * 15

returns the value of the ``price`` item multiplied by 15.

If the ``price`` item doesn't exist, ``getItem`` will return ``None``, and
the formula will raise an exception. The exception is swallowed and the
formula returns ``None`` as well. If the Plomino database is running in
debug mode, the exception will be logged. If the ``price`` item contains
a string or a truth value instead of a number, you'll also get an exception. 
Plomino needs to be coded defensively!

.. Note::
    a formula does not necessarily need to return a value -- you may
    just need to make some changes in some documents (for instance if it
    is the formula in a Plomino action), so the return value would be
    irrelevant.

``plominoDocument`` is a reserved name which corresponds to the
current document on which the formula is evaluated.

``plominoContext`` is a reserved name which corresponds to the
context in which the formula is evaluated. In some cases the formula is
executed on an object which is not a Plomino document (but a :term:`view`,
or a :term:`form`, for instance). 

.. Note::
    Technically, ``plominoDocument`` and ``plominoContext`` are just targeting
    the very same object, which is the Zope ``context``.  ``plominoDocument``,
    ``plominoContext``, ``context`` can be used identically.

Besides these names, many functions defined in ``PlominoUtils`` are 
available within the context of a formula. In addition, Plomino sets 
the ``plomino_form_ids`` key on the ``REQUEST``, which contains a list
cumulative list of all the forms rendered, with the most recent form last.
This allows fields on subforms to figure out what form they were rendered from.

Document items should be accessed using the ``getItem()`` method:
``plominoDocument.getItem('validationDate')``. 

To change an item value, use the ``setItem()`` method: 
``plominoDocument.setItem('firstname', 'Eric')``

You can access the parent Plomino database of the document (or view, or
form, according the context) using the ``getParentDatabase()`` method.

You can also access the views and the other documents. Example::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    view = db.getView('pendingPurchases') 
    total = 0 
    for doc in view.getAllDocuments(): 
        total = total + doc.getItem('price')
    return total

(this example computes the total amount for the pending purchase requests).

You can check the current user rights or roles. Example::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    member = db.getCurrentMember() 
    if db.hasUserRole(member.id, '[Expert]'): 
        return True 
    elif db.isCurrentUserAuthor(doc): 
        return True 
    elif 'PlominoEditor' in db.getCurrentUserRights(): 
        return True 
    else: 
        return False

You can change the author access rights on a given document by modifying
its ``Plomino_Authors`` item.

This item is created automatically for any document and contains the
user id of the document creator. If you want your document to be
editable by users other than its creator, it can contain other ids as
well. Example::

    authors = plominoDocument.getItem('Plomino_Authors') 
    authors.append('[Expert]') 
    if not 'inewton' in authors: 
        authors.append('inewton') 
    plominoDocument.setItem('Plomino_Authors', authors)

As you can see in this example, you can add user ids and/or user roles.

For a better understanding of the methods available on Plomino objects,
see below in this document.

.. _actions:

Actions
=======

By default, Plomino offers few standard actions (**Exit**, **Save**,
**Delete**, **Edit**, etc.) depending on the object type (document,
view, form), on the current mode (read mode or edit mode), and on the
user access rights.

To improve the application usability, you may need to add more actions
in the forms or in the views.

To create an action, select ``Plomino: action`` in the :guilabel:`Add item`
Plone menu.

.. image:: images/6cee3f7f.png

Enter an identifier and a title.

Then select the action type:

- :guilabel:`Open form`: open the form indicated by the ``Parameter or
  code`` parameter to create a new document.

- :guilabel:`Open view`: open the view indicated by the ``Parameter or
  code`` parameter.

- :guilabel:`Close`: go back to the database home page.

- :guilabel:`Save`: submit the form with its current content, and save (or
  create) the document.

- :guilabel:`Python script`: run the formula entered in ``Parameter or
  code``, and redirect to the current object (in read mode). Examples: send
  a mail notification to someone, compute a field value and update the
  document with this new value, etc. If the formula returns a string,
  Plomino will assume it is a URL and use it for redirection.

- :guilabel:`Redirect`: similar to ``Python script``, but the formula is 
  executed *before* the document is rendered, not when the button or link is
  clicked. The script should return an URL which is used as a link or button
  target. By including URL parameters in the returned URL, it can be used to
  links to a form with fields pre-filled.  A better name for this action type
  may be *Computed link*.

You can add a :term:`hide-when` formula to control when the action should be
visible or not.

If you select :guilabel:`Display action in action bar`, the action will be
displayed together with the standard Plomino actions in the action bar.

But (in forms only) you can also choose to insert the action within the
form layout directly.

With Tinymce, actions can be created and inserted directly in the form layout
from the editor.

Example:

.. image:: images/m2899c882.png

With kupu, you must use the :guilabel:`Plomino action` style, and the action
will be rendered according the :guilabel:`Action` display parameter (link,
submit button, or button).

Example:

.. image:: images/5eabcd6.png

Result:

.. image:: images/67218c9.png


Fields
======

.. _computed-fields:

Computed fields
---------------

In a form, the fields where the user can enter data are in *edit* mode.
Upon form submission, user-submitted fields are set on the document *before*
computed fields are evaluated. 

You might also need to use fields which can not be changed by the user.
Here are the other modes offered in Plomino:

:guilabel:`Computed`
    the field value is computed with a formula each time the document is
    opened, and it is saved each time the document is saved.

:guilabel:`Computed on creation`
    the field value is computed only once, the first time the document
    is saved.

:guilabel:`Computed on save`
    the field value is computed and stored each time the document is
    saved.

:guilabel:`Computed for display`
    the field value is computed each time the document is opened, but it
    is not saved.

Example: create a :guilabel:`Computed for display` field with this formula::

    category = plominoDocument.getItem('bookCategory') 
    if category: 
        index = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase().getIndex() 
        others = index.dbsearch({'bookCategory': category}) 
        result = "There are %s other books in the same category" % len(others)-1
        return result
    return "" 

and insert it in the ``frmBook`` form: 

.. image:: images/m434a6b5d.png 

A :guilabel:`Computed for display` field with *no* formula specified
will render the item with the corresponding id, if it exists.

.. Note:: If your computed field A depends on computed field B, the formula
    for A needs to compute B first. This will result in B being computed
    twice, so consider caching if needed. 

.. Note:: Commenting out parts of a form by editing the HTML hides that from 
    the browser, but not from Plomino: if the commented part(s) contain
    computed fields, they will still be computed.

Validation
----------

By default, Plomino validates fields according to their type (for instance,
letters are not allowed in a :ref:`number-field`).

You can also add more validation criteria in the field's
:guilabel:`Validation` tab:

- a field can be **mandatory**: if the field is empty when the document is
  saved, Plomino does not save the document and displays an alert to the
  user.

- you can enter a formula to implement a specific **validation rule** (which
  may depend on other field values).

For instance, in a *Purchase request* application, the maximum authorised
amount is 1000 euros. You would enter the following formula in the
``TotalAmount`` field::

    if plominoDocument.TotalAmount>1000: 
        return 'The total amount must be under 1000 euros' 
    else: 
        return ''

If you need to compare the submitted values to the currently stored state of
the document, you need to look up the stored document first::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase()
    plominoDocument_stored = db.getDocument(plominoDocument.id)

.. Note:: the formula must return an empty string if validation succeeds or
   an error message if it does not.

Doclinks
--------

A Doclink field allows a Plomino document to reference another document.

The doclink stores the path to the targeted document, and it is
displayed as a link.

You may use a :term:`view` as the source of possible targeted documents.

Example
```````

We have a Contact form allowing users to enter contact information about
company employees.

The view ``allcontacts`` returns all the contact documents:

.. image:: images/m55c9e282.png

We add a doclink field, named ``manager``, in the Contact form to enter
the corresponding manager of each employee.

.. image:: images/5ef4a230.png

It uses the ``allcontacts`` view as its document list source, and
displays the ``name`` column value as label:

.. image:: images/m4fdd0770.png

In read mode, the field displays a link to the corresponding document:

.. image:: images/m52601ab7.png

If you choose the ``Embedded view`` widget, the field displays the view
itself (including all columns), with a checkbox to select documents:

.. image:: images/m2eb3ebc9.png

Instead of using a view, you can compute the document list using a
formula (which will override the Embedded view widget), so you can
filter the documents you want to list, you can retrieve documents from
another database, or even list Plone objects which are not Plomino
documents. For example::

    contactsdb = plominoDocument.restrictedTraverse("/Plone/demo/contacts") 
    view = contactsdb.getView('allcontacts') 
    return [d.lastname+"|"+d.getPath() for d in view.getAllDocuments()] 

.. Note::
    in this example, we use the ``getAllDocuments`` method to get the
    documents list, this method returns Catalog brains.

    To improve performance, the ``lastname`` field has been added to the
    index, so there is no need to wake up the objects (using
    ``getObject``), and we use the ``getPath`` method to get the path of the
    real object.
    
.. Todo:: 
    Hmm, ``getAllDocuments`` doesn't sound like it will return brains, it
    sounds like it will return documents. Looking at the source code, I
    see that it does in fact return documents (``d.getObject() for d in
    res``) so this must have changed since 1.3. 

.. _field-templates:

Field templates
---------------

You can create a custom template to render a field in a different way
than the regular field widgets.

The field template must be added in the Resources folder in the ZMI (go
to :guilabel:`Design` tab / :guilabel:`Others` / :guilabel:`Resources
folder`) as a Page Template.

To be applied, the template id must be then entered in the :guilabel:`Field
read template` or in the :guilabel:`Field edit template`.

The template code can be copied from the Plomino products sources
(`CMFPlomino/skins/cmfplomino_templates/**FieldEdit.pt` or
`**FieldRead.pt`).

Here is an example showing a multi-categorized tag field:

Edit template:

.. code-block:: html

    <span tal:define="
        field options/field;
        db options/field/getParentDatabase;
        categories python:
            [doc.getObject() for doc in db.getView('tags').getAllDocuments()]
        ">
    <table><tr>
    <tal:loop repeat="cat categories">
        <td valign="top" tal:define="
            c cat/tagCategory;
            tags cat/tagList
            ">
        <span tal:content="c">category</span>
        <select tal:attributes="name options/fieldname"
            multiple="true"
            lines="4">
        <tal:block repeat="v python:
            [t+'|'+c+':'+t for t in tags.split(',')]
            ">
            <tal:block define="
                current options/fieldvalue;
                l python:v.split('|')
                ">
                <option tal:attributes="
                    value python:l[1];
                    selected python:test(current and l[1] in current,1,0)
                    "
                    tal:content="python:l[0]">value</option>
            </tal:block>
        </tal:block>
        </select>
        </td>
    </tal:loop>
    </tr>
    </table>
    </span>

Result:

.. image:: images/46da1d8b.png

Read template:

.. code-block:: html

    <tal:block tal:repeat="v options/selection">
        <tal:block define="
            current options/fieldvalue;
            l python:v.split('|')
            ">
            <tal:block condition="
                python:test(current and l[1] in current,1,0)">
                <tal:block define="
                    v python:l[0];
                    cat python:v.split(':')[0];
                    t python:v.split(':')[1]
                    ">
            <br/><span class="discreet" tal:content="cat">category</span>
            <span class="callout" tal:content="t">category</span>
                </tal:block>
            </tal:block>
        </tal:block>
    </tal:block>

Result:

.. image:: images/2c92d666.png

Filling fields from the REQUEST
-------------------------------

Editable fields which are not part of the layout take their value from the
``REQUEST``.

So, for example, if you want to pass a parameter to another form:

- in the origin document, put the parameter(s) in the link to the target
  form, e.g. by adding ``?param1=value&param2=value`` to the URL. This will
  cause the parameter to be part of the ``GET`` request which retrieves the
  target form. 
- in the target form, create an editable field with the same id as the
  parameter key (e.g. ``param1`` and ``param2`` above), but do not insert it
  in the form layout. The field will get its value from the ``REQUEST``.  -
  then you can create :guilabel:`Computed on save` (or on display, or
  whatever)
  fields which use the value of this field.

Field labels
------------

Form layouts may contain field labels. See `field labels`_ below.


Forms
=====

Document id and title formulas
------------------------------

:guilabel:`Document title formula`
  Compute the document title

:guilabel:`Compute document title on view`
  Execute the document title formula whenever the document is rendered

:guilabel:`Store dynamically computed title`
  Store the computed title (if different from the stored value) every time
  the document is rendered. (Watch out, this can become a hotspot if it 
  causes many writes.)

:guilabel:`Document id formula`
  Compute the document id at creation. (Undergoes normalization.)

Field labels
------------

A field label corresponds to a field. 
To create a label, add text with the format ``fieldid: Label`` 
or just ``fieldid`` to the layout, select this text,
and select the *Plomino Label* style from the TinyMCE styles dropdown.

The ``fieldid`` has to correspond to a field in the layout. 

If no label is specified (i.e. ``fieldid``), the field title is used as the label.

In *edit* mode, labels for single-input fields are rendered as an HTML 
``<label for='FIELDID'>LABEL</label>`` element.

In *read* mode, labels for single-input fields are rendered as an HTML 
``<span class='label' title='Label for FIELDID'>LABEL</span>`` element.

In *edit* mode, labels for composite fields such as checkboxes, radio buttons,
and picklists are rendered as a 
``<fieldset><legend>LABEL</legend>...</fieldset>`` structure, 
wrapping the target field.

In *read* mode, labels for composite fields are rendered as a 
``<div class='fieldset'><span class='legend' title='Legend for FIELDID'>LABEL</span>...</div>``
structure.

Note that ``label`` elements are rendered in-place 
(which may be anywhere in the layout), 
while ``fieldset`` elements are rendered around the target field.


Events
------

In a Plomino form, you can use the following events:

``onOpenDocument``
    executed before document is opened (in both read mode and edit mode)

    If the formula for this event returns a false value, opening is
    allowed; but if it returns a true value, e.g. a string,
    opening fails, and the value is displayed as an error
    message.

``beforeSaveDocument``
    executed before submitted values are stored into the document. Submitted
    values can be found in ``context.REQUEST``.

``onSaveDocument``
    executed after editable and computed items have been stored, and before
    document is re-indexed.

``onDeleteDocument``
    executed before document is deleted

``onCreateDocument``
    executed before the document is saved for the first time
    (``onSaveDocument`` will also be executed, but after
    ``onCreateDocument``)

``beforeCreateDocument``
    executed before a blank form is opened.
    
In the :guilabel:`Events` tab, you can enter the formulas for each event you
need.

Example: enter the following formula for the ``onSaveDocument`` event::

    date = DateToString(DateTime()) 
    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    user_name = userFullname(db, db.getCurrentMember()) 
    plominoDocument.setItem(
        'history',
        plominoDocument.getItem('history') +
        "This document has been modified by "+user_name+" on "+date)

It will update the ``history`` item which logs all the modifications,
authors and dates.

Hide-when formulas
------------------

In a form, it might be useful to hide or display some sections according
different criteria (an item value, the current date, the current user's
access rights, etc.).

To do so, you must use Hide-when formulas.

Select :guilabel:`Plomino: hide when` in the :guilabel:`Add item` Plone
menu.

Enter an identifier, a title, and a formula. Example:
``plominoDocument.bookState == 'Damaged'``

Then, modify the form layout to insert the hide-when formula in the form
layout. Enter the following: ``start:hide-when-identifier``
at the beginning of the area to hide. And the following at the end:
``end:hide-when-identifier``
And apply the Plomino :guilabel:`Hide-when` formula style to those 2 bounds:

.. image:: images/m33cfb2d3.png

If the :term:`hide-when` formula returns ``True``, the enclosed area will be
hidden. If it returns ``False``, the area is displayed (in our example: if
the book is damaged, it cannot be borrowed, so we hide the action to check
the book availability).

Hide-when formulas can be inserted directly in the form layout using TinyMCE.

Sub-forms
---------

An application can contain several forms.

In the Book library example, we could add a CD form and a Video form.
Those two forms would probably have several similar fields (availability,
last borrower, return date, etc.).

To avoid having to build (and maintain) the same things several times,
you can use sub-forms.

The sub-form principle is to insert a form within another form.

In our example, we create a ``borrowInfo`` form containing the
borrower name, the return date, and the availability, and we insert it
as a sub-form in ``frmBook``, ``frmCD`` and ``frmVideo``.

The form is inserted using the Plomino :guilabel:`Subform` style in Kupu:

.. image:: images/m12bfc6b1.png

Sub-forms can be inserted directly in the form layout using TinyMCE.

.. Note:: 
    as you probably do not want ``borrowInfo`` to be displayed in the
    database home page, you have to check :guilabel:`Hide in menu` in the
    form :guilabel:`Parameters` tab.

.. Note::

    Some fields type are computed independently of rendering, namely
    ``COMPUTED``, ``COMPUTEDONSAVE`` and ``CREATION``. In the case of
    sub-forms, if multiple sub-forms have fields with the same id as the
    including form, or other included forms, those fields will be found
    multiple times. Plomino handles this case by picking the first
    occurrence of the field, and logging the ambiguity (at the ``WARNING``
    log level).

Search formula
--------------

When you create a search form, Plomino uses the form fields to do a
default ZCatalog search among the documents of the view associated with 
the search page.

If needed, you can create a specific search formula in the form
:guilabel:`Parameters` tab.

This formula is used to filter the result set of the default query, and 
must return ``True`` or ``False`` for each document in the result set.

You can access the values submitted by the search form on the ``REQUEST``
object: ``plominoContext.REQUEST.get('myfield')``.

Example::

    period = plominoContext.REQUEST.get('period') 
    if period == 'Ancien regime': 
        return plominoDocument.year 
    if period == 'Empire': 
        return plominoDocument.year >= 1804 and plominoDocument.year

.. Note::
    Search formulas can be a lot slower than regular ZCatalog searches,
    you must use them carefully.

Search event
------------

If you do not want the default filters of a search page (the view, the 
query, and the formula), you can define an ``onSearch`` event on the form
:guilabel:`Events` tab. The formula of this event should return the required
list of documents. 

You can access the values submitted by the search form on the ``REQUEST``
object: ``plominoContext.REQUEST.get('myfield')``.

Page
----

Like a *Search* form, a *Page* form cannot be used to save documents through
the web, since *Page* forms do not display any action bar. (Formulas could
however still call ``save`` on a document using a Page form.)

Like any form, it can contain computed fields, actions (inserted in the form
layout), and hide-when formulas, so it is a good way to build navigation
pages, custom menus, or information pages (like reports, etc.).

Example:

.. image:: images/m8490705.png

Here we create a page with 3 actions to access 3 different views, but
the last one is enclosed in a :term:`Hide-when` formula so it will not be
displayed if the current user does not satisfy a given criterium. In the
example, we test if the user has the ``[dbadmin]`` role::

    "[dbadmin]" not in plominoContext.getCurrentUserRoles()

Result if you are not ``[dbadmin]``:

.. image:: images/78acdcb8.png

Result if you are ``[dbadmin]``:

.. image:: images/5203c813.png

Open-with form
--------------

The form used to render a document is determined by a number of mechanisms:

- By default, Plomino document is displayed using the form corresponding to
  its ``Form`` item value (which contains the id of the form last used to
  save the document).

- If the view from where the document is opened defines a ``Form`` formula,
  the resulting form will be used instead.

- And to force the usage of a given form, the form id can be passed in the
  request using the ``openwithform`` parameter.

Example:

http://localhost:8080/test/testdb/58862f161ea71732944d37e0a0489cfc?openwithform=frmtest

Accordions and lazy loading
---------------------------

In Plomino it is possible to *accordion* some parts of the page.  This means
that the content of the accordioned part will not be visible unless you click
on the headline to open the accordion. 

It is also possible to avoid loading the content of the accordion until such 
time as the accordion is opened. This is particularly useful if the content 
it very big, or if there are many accordions on a page and the reader is
interested in only a few of them.
 
To turn part of a page into an accordion, use this structure (the header level
can be from ``h2`` to ``h6``):

.. code-block:: html

    <h5 class="plomino-accordion-header"><a href="TARGETURL">Header</a></h5>
    <div>Content</div>

If the class is ``plomino-accordion-header``, the content of the page
referenced by ``TARGETURL`` will be substituted for the subsequent div. 

.. Note:: Plomino does not currently offer UI support for this
    functionality.  To use it, you have to generate the desired content via
    Python, or enter it literally into the form layout. 

Caching
-------

To improve performances, it might be useful to cache some fragments of a form
so they are not re-computed every time.

Cached fragments are set in the layout the same way as hide-when formulas, with
``start:cache-identifier`` and ``end:cache-identifier`` markers.
The associated formula is supposed to return a cache key.

When the form is rendered the first time, the resulting HTML contained into the
delimited area will be stored in cache and associated with the cache key.
Every time the form is rendered, if the cache key returned by
the formula matched an existing cache key, the cached HTML is returned.

Consequently, if you use a formula returning always the same value, e.g.::

    "financial-report"

the same cached fragment will be served to all the users in all the cases.

If you use a formula which depends on the current user, e.g.::

    "personal-report-" + context.getCurrentUserId()

then there will be a different cached fragment for each user (so if the same
user displays the form twice, she will received the cached content the second
time, but other users would not get that cached fragment, they would get their
own cache).

The formula might depend on the date::

     "today-report-" + DateToString(Now(), "%Y-%m-%d")

or anything (the document id, any specific item value, etc.).

If the cache key is ``None``, caching is not applied, so for instance::

     if context.isEditMode():
         return None
     else:
         return "something-read"

would show the cached content in read mode, but would always regenerate
the content in edit mode.

Views
=====

Form formula
------------

You may need to read or edit documents using different forms.

For instance, a person who wants to borrow a book wants different
information (book description, category, publication year, etc.) than
the librarian (who may want last borrower, return date, availability,
etc.).

As explained previously, we can manage this issue using :term:`hide-when`
formulas, :term:`action`'s and :term:`sub-form`'s.

But if the functional differences are too great, or if the layout is
totally different, those strategies will probably produce too much
complexity.

In such a case, it is better to create a totally different form (named
``frmBorrowManagement`` for instance).

However, by default the document opens with the form used the last
time it was saved.

To open the document with a different form, you need to create a
specific view for borrowing management and use the ``Form`` formula
parameter.

This formula will compute the name of the form to use when the documents
are opened from the view.

If you enter ``frmBorrowManagement`` in Form formula, all the documents
opened from this view will be displayed using the ``frmBorrowManagement``
form.

View template
-------------

If you need a specific layout for a view, you can create a ZPT page
which can be used instead the default template.

This way, you can build calendar views, Gantt views, produce charts, etc.

To do so, add your Page Template in the resources folder, and enter its
name in :guilabel:`View Template` in the view :guilabel:`Parameters` tab.

A good approach is to copy the ZPT code from
``CMFPlomino/skins/CMFPlomino/OpenView.pt`` (in the Plomino sources) and
add your modifications.

.. Note:: good knowledge of ZPT is required.

Export CSV
----------

All the views can be exported as CSV. The export contains the value of
each column.

Go to the database :guilabel:`Design` tab, expand the :guilabel:`Views`
section and click the green arrow icon next to the view you want to export.

You can build views specifically for export purposes, you just need to
create the columns according the values you want to get in CSV (note: if
you do not want this view to be offered on the database home page, check
:guilabel:`Hide in menu` in the view :guilabel:`Parameters` tab).

Database
========

Refresh a database
------------------

After copy/paste of views or forms, or deletion of fields, a Plomino
database may be corrupted.

If so, you have to refresh the database. This will re-build the database
index entirely, and destroy all the previously compiled Plomino formula
scripts (the first time a formula is called, it is compiled in a Python
Script object in the ZODB).

To do so, go to the database :guilabel:`Design` tab, expand the
:guilabel:`Others` section and click on :guilabel:`Database refresh`.

Refresh also migrates your database to your current Plomino version (if
Plomino has been upgraded since the database was created).

Design import/export
--------------------

You can export or import Plomino database design elements from one Zope
instance to another.

This may be useful if you want to deploy a new application from a
development server to a production server, or if you want to release a
modification or a correction on an application already in production.

To import design elements, go to the database :guilabel:`Design` tab, and in
the :guilabel:`Import/Export Design` section, fill in the following
parameters:

- the URL of the Plomino database which contains the elements you want
  to import in the current database;

- user id and password corresponding to a user account on the remote
  instance. This account must be PlominoManager on the remote Plomino
  database.

Then click on refresh: Plomino will load the list of all the available
elements in the remote database.

.. image:: images/790674a2.png

You can then choose the elements you want and click on :guilabel:`Import` to
import them into the local database.

In some cases (depending on firewalls, proxies, etc.), it is easier to
export from the local database to the remote one.

The principle is the same, you just need to use the :guilabel:`Export`
section.


Replication
-----------

You can replicate documents between 2 Plomino databases, possibly on 2
different Zope servers. 

.. image:: images/45edb683.png

There are 3 replication modes:

push mode
    local modifications are replicated on the remote database;

pull mode
    remote modifications are replicated on the local database;

push-pull mode
    both.

If a document has been modified in both the local and remote databases
since the last replication, there are 3 conflict resolution modes:
- local wins,
- remote wins,
- last modified wins.

Replication can be useful to synchronize information between 2 servers,
or for mobile workers who want to be able to work on a local replica.

Documents XML import/export
---------------------------

In the :guilabel:`Replication` tab (at the bottom), you can import/export
documents from/to an XML file.

.. image:: images/import-export-docs.jpg

Exported documents can be restricted to a view (meanning that only documents
selected in this view will be exported).

Document ids are preserved so if a document already exists in the target
database, it is updated and not duplicated.

.. Note:: when importing from XML, the ``onSaveDocument`` event is not
    called (as document items are all part of the export).

Documents CSV import
--------------------

In the :guilabel:`Replication` tab, you can import documents from a CSV
file.

.. image:: images/import-csv.jpg

You need to indicate which form has to be used to create the documents.

The first row in the CSV file must contain the field id for the intended 
column.

.. Note:: when importing from CSV, the ``onSaveDocument`` event is called
    (as some items might needed to be computed) but the index is not
    refreshed to avoid degrading performance. This means that the index
    needs to be updated manually, possibly by running an agent that re-saves
    imported documents on a schedule, or by refreshing the database on a
    worker ZEO client instance.

Start page
----------

By default, the database default screen is the generic database menu:

.. image:: images/m26047b00.png

But you might prefer to display something else instead (for instance a
view, a page, a search form, etc.).

In this case, go to your database :guilabel:`Edit` tab, and enter the
element id in the :guilabel:`Start page` parameter.

Plomino URLs
============

Database
--------

``OpenDatabase``
    ``http://server/plone/db/OpenDatabase`` will open the database home page
    which either the default home page, either the start page (if defined in
    the database parameters).
    Equivalent to:
        - ``http://server/plone/db``
        - ``http://server/plone/db/view``

``DatabaseDesign``
    ``http://server/plone/db/DatabaseDesign`` will open the database design
    tab.

``DatabaseACL``
    ``http://server/plone/db/DatabaseACL`` will open the database ACL tab.

``DatabaseReplication``
    ``http://server/plone/db/DatabaseReplication`` will open the database
    replication tab.

View
----

``OpenView``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myview/OpenView`` will display the view.
    Equivalent to:
        - ``http://server/plone/db/myview``
        - ``http://server/plone/db/myview/view``

``exportCSV``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myview/exportCSV`` will download the view
    content as a CSV file.

``exportXLS``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myview/exportXLS`` will download the view
    content as an Excel file.

``tojson``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myview/tojson`` will return the view
    content in JSON format.

Form
----

``OpenForm``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myform/OpenForm`` will render the form.
    Equivalent to:
        - ``http://server/plone/db/myform``
        - ``http://server/plone/db/myform/view``

``OpenBareForm``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myform/OpenBareForm`` will render the form
    without the Plone template.
    It is useful when loading the form through an AJAX call, considering the
    Plone skin is not needed in that case, and ``OpenBareForm`` will be more
    performant.

``searchDocuments``
    *Only for search forms.*
    ``http://server/plone/db/myform/searchDocuments?field1=value1`` will
    search and display the search results according the parameters.

``tojson``
    ``http://server/plone/db/myform/tojson`` will return all the form fields
    as JSON.
    ``http://server/plone/db/myform/tojson?item=field1`` will return the form
    field ``field1`` as JSON.

    .. Note:: the parameter is named ``item`` and not ``field`` in order to
        expose the same signature as the document ``/tojson`` URL, so we do
        not need to test the context in field formulas.

Document
--------

``OpenDocument``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/OpenDocument`` will render the document in
    *read* mode.

    Equivalent to:
        - ``http://server/plone/db/doc1``
        - ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/view``

    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/OpenDocument?openwithform=form1``
    will render the document in read mode using the specified form.
    
``EditDocument``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/EditDocument`` will render the document in
    *edit* mode.

    Equivalent to ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/edit``.

    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/EditDocument?openwithform=form1`` will
    render the document in edit mode using the specified form.

``DocumentProperties``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/DocumentProperties`` will show all the
    document information and stored items values.

``AccessControl``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/AccessControl`` will show the current access
    rights and roles in the context of the document.

``delete``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/delete`` will delete the document.
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/delete?returnurl=an_url`` will delete the
    document and redirect to the specified URL.

    .. TODO:: This should use a ``POST``, not a ``GET``.

``getfile``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/getfile?filename=file1`` will download the
    attached file ``file1``.

``deleteAttachment``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/deleteAttachment?fieldname=field1&filename=file1``
    will delete the attached file ``file1`` from the field ``field1``.

    .. TODO:: This should use a ``POST``, not a ``GET``.

``tojson``
    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/tojson`` will return all the document stored
    items as JSON.

    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/tojson?item=item1`` will return the item
    ``item1`` as JSON. In the case of a non-stored item (e.g. a 
    :guilabel:`Computed for display` field), its value will be computed
    using the matching field from the document's form.

    ``http://server/plone/db/doc1/tojson?item=item1&formid=form1`` does the
    same but the field is explicitly looked up from the ``form1`` form (which
    is not necessarily the document's form).

Agent
-----

``runAgent``
    ``http://server/plone/db/agent1/runAgent`` will execute the agent.

``runAgent_async``
    *Requires ``plone.app.async``.*
    ``http://server/plone/db/agent1/runAgent`` will execute the agent in
    asynchronous mode.

Agents
======

It might be useful to launch the same processing from different places
in the application (views action, forms action). To avoid duplicating
the code, you can implement the code in an *agent*.

Select :guilabel:`Plomino: agent` in the :guilabel:`Add item` Plone menu,
and enter an identifier, a title and the code.

This might be useful to run archiving, cleaning, etc. without giving
manager rights to regular users.

By default, an agent runs using the current user access right, but it can also
run using the designer (the owner) access right. That way, a regular user might
launch an action that would normally require higher privileges if he was doing it
manually.

For instance, if an agent is in charge of archiving documents by moving them
from the current database to another one, if regular users do not have
access to the archive db, they would not be able to put some documents in that
db. If the agent is executed as owner, it will not fail.

The agent can be executed (from an action) using the ``runAgent()`` method::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    db.MyAgent.runAgent()

.. Note:: this method can take ``REQUEST`` as parameter (this has to be the
    REQUEST object), which allows variables in the query string to be read
    and redirection to be controlled (using a ``REDIRECT`` key on the
    request).

The agent can also be executed from Python formulas by calling it directly::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    db.MyAgent('one', 'two', 'three')

.. Note:: this method can take optional positional arguments. It does not
    redirect.

If you install ``plone.app.async`` on your Zope instance, an agent can also be
executed in asynchronous mode.

Resources
=========

A Plomino database contains a ``resources`` folder in the ZODB which can
contain useful extra assets:

- images or icons you may need to insert in your forms; 
- CSS or javascript files; 
- ZPT templates (see view template below); 
- Python scripts, to provide a code library usable from the different
  formulas (using the ``callScriptMethod`` method); 
- CSV (or other) files containing useful data; 
- etc.

To access this folder, go to the :guilabel:`Design` tab, expand the
:guilabel:`Others` section and click on :guilabel:`Resources Folder`. It
opens the standard :term:`ZMI` screen, which allows new elements to be
added.

i18n support
============

By declaring an i18n domain in the database parameters, Plomino translation 
will be enabled.

When enabled, any text enclosed by __ will be translated according the defined
i18n domain.

It will apply to form layout static content::

    __What time is it?__

would be rendered as::

    What time is it?
    ¿qué hora es?
    Quelle heure est-il ?

(assuming you have an i18n domain containing the msgid "What time is it?"
and providing the desired languages)

But it will also apply to any computed field output as well::

    return context.getItem('the_hour')+" __hours__"

would be rendered as::

    6 hours
    6 horas
    6 heures

If the text does not match any msgid from the i18n domain, it remains
unchanged (but without the enclosing __).

The translation mechanism can be called from a formula using the ``translate``
function provided by PlominoUtils, which can be handy in agents or view columns.

Caching
=======

RAM cache
---------

If your Plomino application contains some time consuming formulas, you can
speed up the page display by keeping the result in RAM cache using
``getCache`` and ``setCache``.

Here is an example::

    result = db.getCache('my_cache_key')
    if not result:
        result = make_something_which_cost_CPU(stuff)
        db.setCache('my_cache_key', result)
    return result

The first time the formula will be called, the
``make_something_which_cost_CPU`` will be executed, and the result
will be put into the cache.

Next time the formula is called, the result is directly read from the cache.

As the cache key is a constant (``my_cache_key``), it will be the same in
all the cases (for all the users, in all the pages, etc.).

But of course, the ``make_something_which_cost_CPU`` function might return a
different value depending on the context. If so, you need to produce a cache
key that will reflect this context accurately.

For instance, if the result is different according the user, an accurate
cache key could be::

    cache_key = "result_for_"+context.getCurrentUserId()

or depending on the document::

    cache_key = "result_for_"+context.id

or anything you might need.

Request cache
-------------

Another use case is the repeated usage of a same formula in the same page:
sometimes, when rendering a document using a form, several computed fields
make the same computation (typical example: you display a table of values,
and also a bar chart based on those values).

The code itself can be factorized using a script library in the
``/resources`` folder, but it will be run twice anyway when rendering the
page, and this might impact performance.

Unfortunately, ``setCache`` and ``getCache`` might not be relevant because
you want the formula to be re-evaluated every time a user displays the page.
In that case, you can use ``setRequestCache`` and ``getRequestCache``, so
the cache will be
associated with the current request, and will only last as long as the
request::

    result = db.getRequestCache('my_cache_key')
    if not result:
        result = make_something_which_cost_CPU(stuff)
        db.setRequestCache('my_cache_key', result)
    return result


Plomino Element Portlet
=======================

A portlet displaying a Plomino form can be added anywhere in a Plone site.
It can be useful to show information, like statistics or charts (thanks to
Google Visualization, for example), computed when the page is displayed.

.. Note::

    In Plone, when you add a portlet to a page, all of its children pages
    will contain it too. For example, if you add a portlet to the main page
    of the site, it will be displayed in every page of the site. You can
    prevent this mechanism in a child page: 
    click on :guilabel:`Manage Portlets` in this page, find the selector
    next to the name of the portlet 
    (e.g. :guilabel:`Plomino element portlet`), and select guilabel:`Block`.

You can add a portlet on a page with few steps:

- Click on the link :guilabel:`Manage portlets`
- In the :guilabel:`Add portlet...` selector, choose the :guilabel:`Plomino
  element portlet` option.

A new page appears, with some fields:

.. image:: images/element-portlet-edition.png

- The header field sets the title of the portlet.

- The database path is the path of a Plomino database containing
  the form to be displayed. If the base is accessible at the URL
  ``http://example.org/Plone/database``, the path is ``/Plone/database``.
  Since there is always an exception to a rule, you have to be careful when
  the site URLs are re-written (e.g. if the Plone site is behind an Apache
  server). The path must be the *Plone site* path, not the public URL.

- Element ID is the form identifier (set at its creation) in the database
  specified previously.

The new portlet is now displayed alongside the page.

.. image:: images/element-portlet-display.png

You can control whether the portlet must be displayed or not by adding a field
named `Plomino_Portlet_Availability` which formula must return True or
False.

Extending Plomino with plugins
==============================

Plomino provides a set of utility functions in ``PlominoUtils``
(``DateToString``, ``asUnicode``, etc.).

In addition, custom Plomino utilities can be declared in a custom package,
and they will be available from any Plomino formula.

Example:

Create the utility methods in your extension module (e.g.
``mypackage.mymodule``)::

    import simplejson as json

    def jsonify(obj):
        return json.dumps(obj)

    def dejsonify(s):
        return json.loads(s)

Create a class to declare them::

    class MyUtils:
        module = "mypackage.mymodule"
        methods = ['jsonify', 'dejsonify']

Declare the module as safe so it can be called from Python Scripts (all
Plomino :term:`formula` are Python Scripts)::

    from Products.PythonScripts.Utility import allow_module

    allow_module("mypackage.mymodule")

And register it with Plomino in a ``configure.zcml`` file:

.. code-block:: xml

  <utility
        name="MyUtils"
        provides="Products.CMFPlomino.interfaces.IPlominoUtils"
        component="mypackage.mymodule"
        />

Now, ``jsonify`` and ``dejsonify`` can be used in any Plomino formula.
