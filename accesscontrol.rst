Standard Plomino access rights
==============================

Plomino offers 5 standard access levels for any Plomino database:

*Reader*
    can read any document, perform searches,
    but cannot create new documents or modify existing ones.

*Author*
    Reader + can create new documents,
    and modify/delete only documents he/she has created.

*Editor*
    Author + can modify/delete any documents.

*Designer*
    Editor + can change the database design, but cannot edit formulas.

*Manager*
    Designer + can change formulas + can change the access rights.

These rights can be granted to Plone members and/or to Plone groups.

.. Note:: in reality, Designer users could in fact edit formulas,
    we just hide the editing UI.
    So the Designer role is not a security restriction,
    it is just a UI behaviour useful to allow non-coder users to easily modify
    a form layout without breaking the Python code in the different formulas.

Generic users
=============

Plomino handles 2 types of generic users:

*Anonymous*
    users not authenticated on the Plone site.

*Authenticated*
    any authenticated user.

The Plomino standard access rights can be applied to those 2 generic
users, but an anonymous user will never be able to delete a document.

.. Note:: 
    as nothing can differentiate an anonymous user from another one,
    this rule exists to ensure that no one will delete a document created by
    someone else.

Roles
=====

Some applications may need to provide, for specific users, a specific
behaviour which is beyond the basic access rights mechanism we have just
described.

Plomino allows you to create roles which can be applied to Plone users.

By default, a role does not grant any extra rights, but the application
designer will use them as markers to enable specific behaviours in his
application.

For instance, if you build a Plomino application to handle purchase
requests, all the employees will be able to use the form to submit a
purchase request, but in the form you would check for the
``[FinancialReponsible]`` role to allow access to the *Approval* section.

.. Note:: roles are always noted with brackets.

Manage the access rights
========================

Access rights are managed in the tab named :guilabel:`ACL` (Access Control
List).

Application-level access control
================================

In addition to the global access rights, it may also be necessary to
configure access to documents individually.

``Plomino_Readers`` and ``Plomino_Authors``
-------------------------------------------

``Plomino_Readers`` contains the list of users/groups/roles allowed to read
the document.
By default, this item does not exist, so users defined as readers according
the database ACL can read the document.

``Plomino_Authors`` contains the list of users/groups/roles allowed to edit
the document.
By default, this item contains the document creator's id, appending any
other author id during the document life cycle.

Those items can be easily editable using formulas::

    # Make sure that the [purchaser] role can always edit this document
    current_authors = plominoDocument.getItem('Plomino_Authors')
    if '[purchaser]' not in current_authors:
        current_authors.append('[purchaser]')
    plominoDocument.setItem('Plomino_Authors', current_authors)

``onOpenDocument`` event
---------------------------

If the ``onOpenDocument`` event returns a string, it is considered as an
error.
The document will not be displayed, and the returned string will be displayed
as a warning message.

As an example, here is one way to restrict document access to the creator of
the document:

- create a field named ``creator`` (for instance). It should be of type
  ``Name`` and mode ``Computed on creation``, with the following formula::

    plominoDocument.getCurrentUserId()

  This will store the user id of the user who creates the document (it might
  be dangerous to use the ``Plomino_Authors`` item on the document, as its
  value may evolve during the document life cycle).
  
  Add this field to the index.

- add a formula for the ``onOpenDocument`` event to make sure the
  user is the creator (if this formula returns a false value,
  opening is allowed, but if it returns a true value, e.g. a
  string, opening fails, and the value is displayed as an error
  message).

  Here's an example formula::

    member_id = plominoDocument.getCurrentUserId()
    if member_id == plominoDocument.getItem('creator'):
        return None

    roles = plominoDocument.getCurrentUserRoles()
    if "[controller]" in roles:
        return None

    return "You are not allowed to view this document."

.. Note:: in this formula, we're checking for the ``[controller]`` custom
   role, instead of the ``PlominoManager`` role. While this does imply that
   you have to give this role to everyone who has the ``PlominoManager``
   role, it allows you to distinguish between functional managers (who will
   only have the ``[controller]`` role, and technical managers (who will
   also have the ``PlominoManager`` role). 

- create a search form which filters documents where the creator
  field matches the current user id.
